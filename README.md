# Chatbot-using-Python
Chatbot is computer program which is used to interact with user and respond to them.

In this project I have created a simple chatbot with basic functionalities.


Requirements: 
Python 3
  - Chatterbot library
  - Chatbot Corpus library
(You can use 'pip install' to install these libraries)


In this program the responses will be based on the corpus which I used. You can either use this corpus or create your own.
(I have copied the corpus with this you can use it)
